Welcome to Little Village
=========================

Little Village is a collection of programs for working with the Little Man
Computer or LMC.  The LMC is an computer architecture invented to be
understandable to humans.  It uses three-digit words, has a small instruction
set, few registers, and 100 words of memory.  In principle, it can do anything
any other computer can.  In practice, you wouldn't want to do anything much more
demanding than calculating the fines on you overdue library books.  To learn
more see the `Wikipedia entry for Little Man Computer
